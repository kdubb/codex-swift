/// Executes block returning it's value as a  `success` result and any caught errors as a `failure` result.
///
/// - Parameter block: Closure to execute
/// - Returns: The return value of `block` as a `Result.success` unless an error is thrown, in which
///   case the error is returned as a `Result.faulure`.
///
public func catchThrow<R, E>(block: @autoclosure () throws(E) -> R) -> Result<R, E> {
  do {
    return .success(try block())

  }
}

/// Asserts that a function never throws and maps any thrown errors to `fatalError`.
///
/// This functoin is to be for calls that are known to always succeed but would otherwise
/// require a `do {...} catch {...}` block or use of `try?` (which causes the
/// result to be unconditionally optimal), adding unnecessary complexity to what would
/// be simple statements. E.g., calling global and/or static initializers with known valid
/// paramters.
///
/// - Important: The result of using `neverthrow` on statements that are
/// susceptible to runtime errors, is a `fatalError`,  terminating the program. This
/// is not a substitute for proper error handling. Additionally, failures leak information
/// about the source file and line number, which may be useful for debugging, but
/// should not be presented to end users.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - block: The block to execute.
///   - file: The file in which the call to `neverThrow` was made.
///   - line: The line number on which the call to `neverThrow` was made.
/// - Returns: The result of the block.
