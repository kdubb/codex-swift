/// Explicit, and purposefully verbose, force casts value of type ``V`` to type ``T``.
///
/// This is a more verbose version of the `as!` operator, for situations where the
/// case is known to be valid, but the compiler cannot prove it. In addition to being
/// more verbose, it allows providing a more specific error message which defaults
/// to a detailed message including the attempted cast.
///
/// This is especially usefull for codebases that have banned  general use of `as!`.
